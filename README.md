I will be building a basic recipe website.
In order to complete this website I required prior knowledge of links, boilerplates, and command lines in order to set up my files in the correct manner to build the correct pathways for the links in my home page(index.html) to three recipe webpages.
I needed to know how to create images, headlines, paragraphs, and lists in html to format all the recipe information on the webpages.
